Type Projections

 - Java offers use-site variance(when it makes the actual calls),
 while kotlin offers declaration-site variance.

 Sometime use-site variance is required, like upper bound and lower bound.

 In kotlin it is taken care by type projections (Define it on the call)

 - Creates a restricted form of the type, called Type-Projection.



Star Projection - are a safe way to indicate a subtype of projection.

Eg - if(element is List<*>) // if element is list of whatever type parameter
